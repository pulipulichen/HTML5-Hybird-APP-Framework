This is the demo for my presentation at [pécs.web](http://www.meetup.com/pecs-web/messages/boards/thread/29606602)!

##Demo
You can view the demo running in [my site](http://drawain.hu/SpaceSimDemo/).

##Customize for mobile devices
You have to set the **CAAT.DEBUG** to 0 in *init.js* to disable the debugger.
It's recommended to set the canvas width and height to your mobile device screen size at *constants.js*.
After that you can compile the application with the [Cocoon.js cloud compiler](https://cocoonjsservice.ludei.com/cloud/login/) or run it with the [launcher](http://wiki.ludei.com/cocoonjs:launcherapp)!
